# Code block from selection

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) adds a "Code block from selection" command that turns the selected text into a code block. It just adds \`\`\` before and after the selected text. In the plugin settings you can specify which language to use in the code block. You can assign hotkeys to three different languages.

## How to configure

Specify the programming language in the plugin settings (for example "c++"), then add the desired hotkey for the "Code block from selection" command on the Obsidian hotkeys panel.

## How to use

Just select the text with code or put the cursor on the desired line and press hotkey.
